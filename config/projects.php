                    <p>For each of these websites, I developed an admin panel and took on significant responsibilities in the front-end development.</p>
                    <hr><p>During my second employment, I was actively involved in the following two websites:</p>
                    <a class="inline-flex items-center font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"
                    href="https://www.gulangrup.com/" target="_blank">https://www.gulangrup.com/</a><br>

                    href="https://www.aracbul.com/" target="_blank">https://www.aracbul.com/</a>
                    <p>Both websites were focused on searching and filtering second-hand cars.
                    I spent time actively working on database operations, and we created microservices with Laravel.</p>
                    <a class="inline-flex items-center font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"
                    href="https://qiblalastik.com/" target="_blank">https://qiblalastik.com/</a>
                    <p>Additionally, I prepared a total of 6 websites similar to this one.
                    Similar to what I did at Penta YazÄ±lÄ±m, I developed an admin panel for all of them.
                    I converted the HTML files provided to me for the front-end into Laravel Blade format, connected the variables, and made some API calls with JavaScript.
                    Other websites are not publicly available right now.</p>
                    <hr><p>At my last employment, I worked on the backend of &nbsp</p>
                    <a class="inline-flex items-center font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"
                    href="https://nic.tr/" target="_blank">https://nic.tr/</a> <p>It is not a system with a front-end. It is connected to &nbsp</p>
                    <a class="inline-flex items-center font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"
                    href="https://trabis.gov.tr" target="_blank">https://trabis.gov.tr</a> <p>and</p>

                    <p>websites, and the backend feeds these services. I also worked on making these two websites operational.
                    We did not use any frameworks, only PHP.
                    I also had to write Python and Java code for a few specific cases.</p>
